# Eye Exercise

This project was part of the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN Course. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to display a web page with two eyes that follow the user's mouse movement. It uses the [onmousemove property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onmousemove) of the GlobalEventHandlers mixin that processes mousemove events.

## How to Run
* [Clone this GitHub repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
* Open up the index.html file in a browser and move cursor around the page. You should see the eyes following your mouse cursor.

## Roadmap

* Research how to make this experience accessible for mobile users and for users who aren't using a pointer device. Look into [Accelerometer  Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Accelerometer)
* Map out possible use cases for an interaction like this, and the ways it can support or detract from storytelling or relationship building with users
